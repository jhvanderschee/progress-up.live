# Drag and drop 

The way I did the HTML5 drag and drop is quite simple.

All you had to do is plug into the event and you are done.

However I added the nice feature of background change on dragging over.

I find this will really help the usability.

## Challenges

As such, drag and drop could easily be implemented across all platforms.

I did not face any major hassles or troubles.

The logic flow after dropping files is same as file upload from mouse
click.

The drop area being large, there should not be any trouble with the drag
and drop usability.

But at one time you must use either all files in drag and drop or file
select.

Right now, there is no mixed operation.

At one time you must select all files scheduled for uploading.

## How drag and drop helps

It is not just a convenience feature.

In each plugin drag and drop works a little differently as it is coded
differently.

But the functionality must be same.

The way the drag and drop function works in

- svelte
- angular
- vue
- react

is by tapping into `dragenter`, `dragleave` and `drop` events.

The way this works is similar to other javascript browser events.

Once the drop is complete drag and drop completes.
